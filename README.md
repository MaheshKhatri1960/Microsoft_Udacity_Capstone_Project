# Microsoft Azure Automated ML & Hyperdrive Best Model Training & Deployment for Predictions From Kaggle Heart Failure Dataset 

TO DO:* This project consists of using Microsoft Azure machine learning (ML) to make predictions from the Kaggle Heart Failure <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/andrewmvd/heart-failure-clinical-data">dataset</a>. It has 3 phases. In the 1st phase, a model is trained using Azure Microsoft's <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/concept-automated-ml">AutoML (Automated ML)</a>. In the 2nd phase, Microsoft Azure's <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/how-to-tune-hyperparameters">Hyperdrive</a> package which can efficiently and speedily automate the learning using combinations of a machine learning model's hyperparameters. At this stage a comparison is made between the quality of the predictions made by both the AutoML and Hyperdrive phases. The model which returned the best predictions from between the two approaches is then deployed. After deployment, it is tested with sample data to demonstrate it's functioning.     

## Project Set Up and Installation
*OPTIONAL:* If your project has any special installation steps, this is where you should put it. To turn this project into a professional portfolio project, you are encouraged to explain how to set up this project in AzureML.

## Dataset

### Overview
*TODO*: Explain about the data you are using and where you got it from.

### Task
*TODO*: Explain the task you are going to be solving with this dataset and the features you will be using for it.

### Access
*TODO*: Explain how you are accessing the data in your workspace.

## Automated ML
*TODO*: Give an overview of the `automl` settings and configuration you used for this experiment

### Results
*TODO*: What are the results you got with your automated ML model? What were the parameters of the model? How could you have improved it?

*TODO* Remeber to provide screenshots of the `RunDetails` widget as well as a screenshot of the best model trained with it's parameters.

## Hyperparameter Tuning
*TODO*: What kind of model did you choose for this experiment and why? Give an overview of the types of parameters and their ranges used for the hyperparameter search


### Results
*TODO*: What are the results you got with your model? What were the parameters of the model? How could you have improved it?

*TODO* Remeber to provide screenshots of the `RunDetails` widget as well as a screenshot of the best model trained with it's parameters.

## Model Deployment
*TODO*: Give an overview of the deployed model and instructions on how to query the endpoint with a sample input.

## Screen Recording
*TODO* Provide a link to a screen recording of the project in action. Remember that the screencast should demonstrate:
- A working model
- Demo of the deployed  model
- Demo of a sample request sent to the endpoint and its response

## Standout Suggestions
*TODO (Optional):* This is where you can provide information about any standout suggestions that you have attempted.
